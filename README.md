# LLM Security and Performance Enhancement Suite

## Introduction
The LLM Security and Performance Enhancement Suite is a comprehensive toolkit designed to enhance the security, performance, and fairness of Large Language Models (LLMs). This project focuses on developing robust solutions for real-world machine learning challenges, including veracity checking, prompt injection defense, data drift detection, model performance monitoring, bias detection, and providing explainable AI insights.

## Features

### Veracity Checker
- Validates the truthfulness of responses generated by LLMs against known facts.

### Prompt Injection Defense
- Detects and mitigates attempts to manipulate model outputs through malicious input prompts.

### Data Drift Detection
- Monitors the input data to the LLMs over time, detecting significant deviations from the training data distribution.

### Model Performance Monitoring
- Tracks and analyzes the performance of your LLM models over time to ensure they continue to meet expected standards.

### Bias Detection
- Analyzes the outputs of LLMs to detect potential biases and ensure fairness across different demographic groups.

### Model Explanation and Interpretability
- Utilizes SHAP or LIME to provide insights into the decision-making process of your machine learning models.
